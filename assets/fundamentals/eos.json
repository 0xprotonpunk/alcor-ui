  "description": "A branch of the antelope{cache} protocol, eos{cache} is a sovereign RAM mining protocol that fosters an open market where participants compete for market share of ECACHE, by virtue of RAM held in reserve. The contract is governed exclusively by mining weight of its participants, who can vote to modify the contractâ€™s ABI/WASM and transaction fees. eos{cache} operates with one-hour block intervals, featuring an initial block reward of 26.2144 ECACHE, which halves every 20,000 blocks, and incorporates token burns dynamically pegged to RAM prices. Deployed on three leading Antelope Networks including, WAX, TELOS, and EOS, each with its own token (WCACHE, TCACHE, and ECACHE respectively), it not only creates cross-chain RAM arbitrage opportunities but also redefines the concept of commodity-backed cash, specifically RAM-backed cash."
